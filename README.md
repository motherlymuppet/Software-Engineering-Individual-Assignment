# Software-Engineering-Individual-Assignment
A patient information portal creating using javafx for the individual assessment in the software engineering module

Look at the assigment brief for more info on what I was meant to do.

The jar probably won't work given that it was meant to hook into the durham uni database.

I haven't got a mark back for this assignment yet.
